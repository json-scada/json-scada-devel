QUICKSTART:

To quickly run the system after installed, open the JSON-SCADA desktop folder and:

 * On the JSON-SCADA desktop folder: execute _Start_Services.
 * On the JSON-SCADA desktop folder: execute _JSON SCADA WEB.

The system is preconfigured to connect to a online demo simulation via IEC60870-5-104 protocol with an example point list and screens.
To issue a command, click on a breaker and push the "Command" button then choose 
  an action like "open" or "close" and push the action button.
To edit and create new SVG screens, use the customized Inkscape+SAGE 
  (shortcut in the JSON-SCADA folder). 
Screens are in "c:\json-scada\src\htdocs\svg\".
JSON SCADA configuration files are in "c:\json-scada\conf\".
For more info about configuration please read the documentation.

By default, the system is configured to allow HTTP access only by the local machine.
To allow other IP addresses edit the "c:\json-scada\conf\nginx_access_control.conf" file.
To configure safe remote client access, configure IP address access control, HTTPS, 
  client certificates and user authentication directly in the Nginx configuration files.

Locally installed databases MongoDB and Postgresql are configured for local access only with relaxed access control 
  and authorization. The system can be reconfigured to access databases on external servers with full security.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The customized Inkscape SVG graphics editor is a derivative of the Inkscape Project
 work and of the Ecava SAGE work, it is not in any way associated with the Inkscape 
 Project nor Ecava.
We respect and intend to comply with the branding policy of the Inkscape Project
  https://inkscape.org/en/about/branding/
In our view, the modifications introduced are not substantial and do not intend 
  to create a competitive product.
The modifications introduced are meant only to allow the use of the software as a 
  SCADA Synoptic Editor.
We respect the GPL license of the upstream work by making the source code of the 
  modifications to the original Inkscape and SAGE code available at:
