# Project IDX Setup

Start a free instance for dev/test on Google's Firebase Studio platform with just a Google account.

1. Access the Firebase Studio platform, click on the "Get Started" button. Connect your Google account if asked.

    [https://firebase.studio](https://firebase.studio)

2. Click on the "Import Repo" button to importing a GitHub repository.

    * Repo URL: https://github.com/riclolsen/json-scada
    * Name: json-scada
    * Select the "Mobile development with Flutter / Android Studio" option, this way you will get a 32 GB/8 vCPU instance.

    Alternatively, you can fork the repo on Github and import it from there.

3. Wait for the workspace to be imported and built. This will take a while, do not click the recover button. When started, some terminals will open to initialize and build the project. Wait until all the tasks are finished and the workspace is ready. This will take some minutes.

4. Click the "Firebase Studio" button on left sidebar and select "Backend Ports". Click the "Open New Window" action for port 8080. This will give access to the web UI for the project. Login with admin/jsonscada credentials.

5. On the VSCode's terminal, control JSON-SCADA processes with the "supervisorctl" command.  

```bash
    supervisorctl status
    supervisorctl start all
    supervisorctl stop all
    supervisorctl restart all
    supervisorctl stop iec104client
    supervisorctl start iec104client
    supervisorctl tail -f iec104client
```

Open the Gemini chat with Ctrl+Shift+Space.

Notice that the provided free VM is a constrained environment with limited resources: 32 GB RAM, 8-core CPUs, and 15GB storage space.
