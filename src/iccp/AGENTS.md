# DOX: src/iccp — ICCP TASE2 Protocol Drivers

## Purpose

ICCP (IEC 60870-6 / TASE.2) client and server protocol drivers for JSON-SCADA, written in Go. Provides interoperability with utility control center systems using the ICCP/TASE.2 standard.

## Ownership

- iccp owns the ICCP client and server implementations
- The tase2 subdirectory contains the TASE2 library dependency
- Interop boundaries: MongoDB change streams (in), real-time data events (out)

## Local Contracts

- **Language:** Go (1.21+)
- **Dependencies:** `go.mod` / `go.sum`
- **Build:** `GOWORK=off go build` in component directories
- Sub-projects:
  - `iccp-client/` — ICCP TASE.2 client driver
  - `iccp-server/` — ICCP TASE.2 server driver
  - `tase2/` — TASE.2 communication library (closed source, 100% native Go)
- Configuration via the central `json-scada.json` or environment variables
- Uses MongoDB Go driver for database access
- `iccp-client` and `iccp-server` are intentionally commented out of `src/go.work`; build and test them standalone with `GOWORK=off`
- Each module resolves the library through `replace github.com/riclolsen/tase2 => ../tase2`, so `tase2/` must be checked out at a compatible revision (currently `origin/main` at `v0.4.0`+)

## Work Guidance

- ICCP uses the TASE.2 MMS protocol — be familiar with IEC 60870-6 standards
- The TASE2 library is closed source; treat as an opaque dependency
- Client side: initiate connections to remote ICCP servers
- Server side: accept connections from remote ICCP clients
- Both sides: support TCP/TLS transport
- Follow Go idioms: `error` returns, `context.Context`, idiomatic naming
- Use the exported `tase2` quality constants (`QualityValid`/`QualityHeld`/`QualitySuspect`/`QualityInvalid`, `SourceTelemetered`/`SourceCalculated`/`SourceEntered`/`SourceEstimated`) instead of literal strings; decoded values only ever use the canonical names, while legacy spellings such as `questionable`, `substituted` and `process` are accepted on encode only and will silently fail to match on decode
- Time stamps: the server publishes indication points as IEC 60870-6-802 Ed.2 `*QTimeTagExtended` types (`TimeStampExtended` = GMT seconds + milliseconds, UTC) stamped from `timeTagAtSource`; the client reads every time stamp through `DecodedPoint.Time()` plus `hoursShift`. Never use the deprecated `TimeTagNow`/`TimeTagFrom` (legacy milliseconds since local midnight) — `TimeStampFrom` is the second-resolution form

## Verification

- `GOWORK=off go build ./...` in `iccp-client/` and `iccp-server/`
- `GOWORK=off go vet ./...` and `GOWORK=off go test ./...` in each module (both have unit plus in-process loopback tests; no MongoDB required)
- Run the same checks after bumping `tase2/`: the library compiles against unchanged driver code even when quality or data-model semantics shift, so the tests are the real gate
