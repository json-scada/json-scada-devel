/**
 * Byte-order adjustments for values already decoded by PLC4X.
 *
 * PLC4X delivers values interpreted with the protocol default byte order
 * (big-endian for Modbus). "LITTLE_ENDIAN" means the device actually stores
 * little-endian words, so the bytes must be swapped; "REV_ENDIAN" is an
 * unconditional reverse; "BIG_ENDIAN" or empty is a no-op. This is applied
 * consistently to all multi-byte types (the Go driver was inconsistent here).
