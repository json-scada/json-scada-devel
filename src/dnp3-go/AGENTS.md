# DOX: src/dnp3-go — DNP3 Client and Server Drivers (Go)

## Purpose

Pure-Go DNP3 master and outstation drivers for JSON-SCADA. Drop-in alternatives to the C++
drivers in `src/dnp3`: same `protocolDriver` names (`DNP3`, `DNP3_SERVER`), same configuration
documents, same MongoDB semantics, no opendnp3, mongo-cxx-driver, OpenSSL, vcpkg or CMake.

## Ownership

- dnp3-go owns the Go implementation of both DNP3 drivers
- `src/dnp3` (C++) remains the reference implementation; behaviour is matched to it

## Local Contracts

- **Language:** Go 1.26, module `dnp3-go`, `cmd/` + `internal/` layout as in `src/iec60870-5`
- **Library:** `github.com/dscsystems/go-dnp3` v0.5.3 (GPLv3+, pure Go) — **pin the version**,
  the API is pre-1.0 and the SKILL.md in that repo says so explicitly. JSON-SCADA is GPL-3.0, so
  the copyleft is not a problem; note it rather than re-litigating it.
  - Used beyond the basics: device attributes (group 0) on the server, `multidrop.Bus` everywhere.
    Not used: file transfer (group 70) and `multidrop.Registry` — `dnp3util.BuildGroups` owns bus
    construction. `multidrop.DefaultQueue` is still 16, so `StationQueue` is still needed.
  - v0.5.0 widened `dnp3.Indexed.Index` (and `master.Update.Index`) to `uint32`. It also
    reports each point in its own static variation on a class 0 read, freezes and reassigns
    class only for the points a request names, clears the event overflow indication once the
    master confirms, and sets OVER_RANGE on values an integer variation cannot hold.
  - v0.5.2 renumbered the derived device attributes to IEEE 1815-2012 set 0 (counts at
    221/224/229/233/236/239, fragment sizes 240/241; earlier releases used 208–228), fixed the
    display names and `dnp3-explorer` labels to match, and answers the g0v255 list of attributes
    (`dnp3.AttrAttributeList`, `Attribute.List()`, `objects.ListAttribute`).
  - v0.5.3 fixed `dnp3.ControlClose`/`ControlTrip`, which every earlier release had transposed
    (close is trip/close code 1 = 0x40, trip is 2 = 0x80). **Builds on earlier releases sent trip
    for close** on durations 11/13/21/23 and read a standard close as 0. It also clears the request
    error IIN bits (NO_FUNC_CODE_SUPPORT, OBJECT_UNKNOWN, PARAMETER_ERROR, ALREADY_EXECUTING) once
    a response has reported them, and widened `decoder.Value.Index` to `uint32`.
  - Stats counters available if the stats document ever wants them:
    `outstation.Stats.RepeatedRequests`/`IncompleteRequests`, `master.Stats.FragmentsDiscarded`.
  - Before the next bump, diff the API of the packages this module imports rather than trusting
    the version number: pre-1.0 minors may break.
- **Binaries:** `dnp3-client(.exe)` and `dnp3-server(.exe)`. They must **not** collide
  case-insensitively with `Dnp3ClientCpp.exe` / `Dnp3Server.exe`, so both implementations can
  live in `bin/` during migration. Do not rename them to `dnp3client` / `dnp3server`.
- **Packages:**
  - `cmd/dnp3client`, `cmd/dnp3server` — entry points, banner, CLI, config file
  - `src/go-common` (via a `replace` directive) — configuration (`jsconfig`), the levelled logger
    (`jslog`), BSON accessors and client factory (`jsmongo`), redundancy (`jsredundancy`) and
    the other shared JSON-SCADA helpers
  - `internal/dnp3util` — group tables, quality mapping, CROB codes, endpoints, the
    `multidrop.Bus` grouping layer, the counting and link-state channel wrappers
  - `internal/clientapp` — the master driver (← `Dnp3ClientCpp`)
  - `internal/serverapp` — the outstation driver (← `Dnp3Server`)
- **Build:** `build.bat`, or `go build -ldflags="-s -w" -o ../../bin/dnp3-client ./cmd/dnp3client`
- **Config:** `conf/json-scada.json` plus MongoDB documents; CLI `<instance> <logLevel> <configFile>`

## Work Guidance

- The C++ drivers are the specification. Before changing behaviour, check what `src/dnp3` does.
  Quirks are reproduced on purpose and marked `parity:` in comments; intentional differences are
  numbered D1..D27 in `README.md` — add to that list rather than diverging silently.
- Only `sourceDataUpdate` is written for client data; never the tag `value`, alarms or history.
- All numbers written to MongoDB must be Go `float64` so they land as BSON doubles. The `stats`
  counters are the exception: they are `int64`, as in the C++ drivers.
- **Do not set a client-level `Timeout` on the MongoDB client.** It applies to every operation
  including a change stream's `Next`, so the watchers get torn down and rebuilt on each expiry.
  Every call that needs a bound passes its own context deadline.
- **Periodic class scans must be re-registered on every connection.** `master.Session.Run` calls
  its startup sequence on each connect, and that begins by clearing the task scheduler — a scan
  registered once is dropped, and the session then polls nothing but its own startup integrity
  read. `classScanLoop` watches `Connected()` and re-registers on each rising edge.
- **Configure the analog variations explicitly.** go-dnp3 defaults analogs to the 32-bit integer
  variations, so an unconfigured point truncates 123.5 to 123. The server applies g30v5/g32v7 to
  every analog and g40v3/g42v7 to every analog output status, as the C++ server does.
- **Every event variation carries an absolute time** (D27). A change of any digital or analog
  point is reported as a timed event; `variationsFor` must never select an untimed one (g32v1/2/5/6,
  g22v1/2, g42v1/2 and the like) — `TestEveryEventCarriesTime` enforces it. The event time comes
  from `timestampFor`: `timeTagAtSource`, then `timeTag`, then now.
- **Point indexes arrive as `uint32` but requests carry `uint16`.** Keep received indexes wide
  (`push` takes `uint32`); an object address sent in a command or range scan must pass
  `validPointIndex` (0..65535) and is refused otherwise, never narrowed — narrowing wraps onto a
  different point (65541 → 5).
- **The server accepts every clock write** (`application.SupportsWriteTime` is always true, README
  Q6), as the C++ server does. Do not make it follow `timeSyncMode`: the outstation asserts
  NEED_TIME until its clock is set, so a refusal is repeated on every connection.
  `TestClockWriteAccepted` pins it.
- **CROB tests pin raw octets, never library constants.** `TestCROBWireCodes` (client) and
  `TestCROBValueWireCodes` (server) compare against the bytes opendnp3 sends; a test written
  against `dnp3.ControlClose`/`ControlTrip` agreed with the transposed constants of go-dnp3
  before v0.5.3 and could not catch a trip sent for a close.
- `outstation.Session.Update` queues the change for the session loop; it is not applied when the
  call returns. A test that changes a value and then scans must poll until the change is reported.
- `Database.Configure` replaces the whole `PointConfig`, so every call is a read-modify-write: a
  zero `Class` is `ClassNone` and silently kills the point's events.
- An outstation has no `Connected()`. Read the link state from the channel the session runs on
  (`dnp3util.WrapLinkState`), never from traffic: the default integrity interval is 300 seconds,
  so an idle-looking station is normal.
- Multi-drop is `multidrop.Bus`, not hand-written framing. Every connection goes on a bus,
  single-station ones included, because the frame and CRC statistics come from it.
- Auto-created command destinations carry an output status companion (`statusGroup` /
  `statusASDU` on `autoCreatePass`), placed on the command's `supervisedOfCommand` twin at **the
  command's own object address**. That address is fixed by the protocol — a CROB at index N
  operates binary output N — so it cannot be reassigned to dodge a clash; report the clash and
  skip instead.
- **`ipAddresses` on an active connection is a list of ways to reach one device**, not a list of
  devices. `ChannelSpec.BuildChannel` makes one inner channel per address and `WrapCountingAll`
  rotates through them: next address on a failure with no delay, backoff only once the whole list
  has been tried, and stay put on success. The channel-sharing `GroupKey` already keys on the
  whole list, so two connections share a channel only when their address lists match.
- **The multi-drop bus needs a large station queue on a socket.** Its default is 16 frames, which
  a large integrity response overruns instantly; a dropped link frame loses the whole application
  fragment and every tag it would have created. `dnp3util.StationQueue` is 4096. Do not lower it.
- **The client value queue coalesces, it does not drop.** Statics for one point collapse to the
  newest; event sequences are kept whole; past the threshold events collapse too and the writer
  reports it. Never restore the C++ drop-the-oldest behaviour: on a large device it discards the
  same points on every poll, so their tags are never created.
- The `sourceDataUpdate` filter relies on the standard realtimeData index on
  `(protocolSourceConnectionNumber, protocolSourceCommonAddress, protocolSourceObjectAddress)`.
  Without it a large batch times out and updates stall while creation continues.
- Device attributes (group 0) live in `serverapp/attributes.go`, numbered per IEEE 1815-2012 set 0
  (the table Wireshark and stepfunc's dnp3 crate use), declared there rather than taken from
  `dnp3.AttributeName`. The driver reports the full capacity block (events supported, highest
  index, count per point type, empty types included) on top of what go-dnp3 derives; configured
  attributes replace derived ones key by key, and `TestAttributesCoverDerived` checks that every
  key the library derives is answered here — keep it passing on every library bump, because a gap
  mixes the library's values into the response. Do not add 249 (conformance) or 248 (serial
  number); see `README.md`. The g0v255 list is answered by the library from the same set.
- **The active channels are built with `channel.NoRetry` and the driver retries in `countchan`.**
  Do not put the retry back into the library channel: it loops inside `Connect` and returns only
  a context error at the end, so `numOpenFail` never increments and the reason the port would not
  open is lost. In that retry loop, `channel.ErrClosed` and a cancelled context must propagate
  rather than be retried: both are an orderly shutdown, a closed channel can never produce a
  connection, and retrying hides the shutdown signal from the session.

## Verification

- `go test ./...` — conversion tables, variation tables, tag documents, grouping and conflict
  detection, plus loopback runs of a real master against a real outstation over `channel.Pipe`
  and over a real mutually authenticated TLS socket. No MongoDB and no hardware needed; the TLS
  tests generate their own certificates into `t.TempDir()`.
- `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -l .` must be clean; `go test -race ./...` for the concurrency.
- End to end: a temporary `mongod` as a single-node replica set (change streams need one), seeded
  with an instance, connections and tags, then both drivers against each other on port 20000.
  Check `sourceDataUpdate`, `stats.isConnected`, the auto-created tags, and that a document
  inserted into `commandsQueue` comes back with `delivered`/`ack`/`resultDescription`.
- Serial: `TestSerialPortPair` carries a real session over two real ports and skips unless
  `-serial.a` and `-serial.b` name a pair, so the gap closes the moment one exists —
  `socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0` on Linux, com0com on Windows (an elevated install).
  Everything else about serial operation is covered without hardware: the configuration mapping,
  the open-failure path, and the link-layer confirmation and arbitration that serial mode turns
  on. A virtual pair could not be created on the development machine used here — WSL2 needs
  virtualization that is not enabled, and com0com needs elevation and, on current Windows, test
  signing, which is a security control not worth disabling for a test.

## Known gaps

- Octet strings (groups 110/111) are decoded and discarded, as in the C++ drivers.
- Device attributes are served but not writable, and the client driver does not read them; there
  is nowhere in the JSON-SCADA schema to put what it would learn.
- Group 50 (time and interval) destinations are unsupported: `outstation.DatabaseConfig` has no
  such family.
- A passive TCP/TLS connection serves one master connection at a time; the bus multiplexes
  outstations, not masters.
- CROB durations 10, 12, 20 and 22 are documented in the driver README but were never implemented
  by the C++ switch; they behave as NUL. Reproduced deliberately.
