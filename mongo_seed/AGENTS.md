# DOX: mongo_seed — MongoDB Seed Data

## Purpose

Initialization scripts and seed data for MongoDB: replica set initialization, database/collection creation, demo data population, roles, and users. Used during fresh installations and Docker setup.

## Ownership

- mongo_seed owns the MongoDB bootstrap and seed data

## Local Contracts

- JavaScript (`.js`) files executed with `mongosh`
- Shell scripts (`.sh`) for automated initialization
- `a_rs-init.js` — replica set initialization
- `b_create-db.js` — database and collection creation, indexes
- `init.sh` — full initialization sequence (Linux)
- `init-demo.sh` — initialization with demo data
- `realtime_data.json` — demo real-time data points
- `roles.json` — RBAC role definitions
- `users.json` — user accounts for demo

## Work Guidance

- Seed data should represent a realistic SCADA system for demos
- Keep demo data manageable in size but representative
- RBAC roles should demonstrate the permission model
- Keep initialization scripts idempotent where possible
- When adding new collections, update both `b_create-db.js` and documentation

## Verification

- Test with `mongosh < script.js` against a local MongoDB instance
- Verify replica set initialization works with `rs.initiate()`
